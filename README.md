S.O.L.O.M.O.N. = Support Oriented Linguistic Operation Matrix Organized Natively

The intention of this application is to develop a natively stored personal assistant that is able to interact with the end user and function off of a local network connection without constant internet connection. Ideally leveraging edge based technology using lightweight software/language model to compute written/verbal input and respond or perform basic tasks.
