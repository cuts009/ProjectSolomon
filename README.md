# Project SOLOMON v0.0 (Pre-Prototype - Production Ongoing)

S.O.L.O.M.O.N. = Support Oriented Linguistic Operation Matrix Organized Natively

The intention of this application is to develop a natively stored personal assistant that is able to interact with the end user and function off of a local network connection without constant internet connection. Ideally leveraging edge based technology using lightweight software/language model to compute written/verbal input and respond or perform basic tasks.

Current Blueprint includes 3 Packages & Intentions:

    Ears - Recieve Input (Speech to Text)

    Cerebrum - Process Input & Produce Output (NLP)

    Tongue - Deliver Output (Text to Speech)

4th Package included in Repo is Skills, at this time it is currently a placeholder for possible executable Skills.
